# Bike-sharing system
> 
BoomBikes:

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short
term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is
usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This
bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared
bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in
the American market. The company wants to know:<br>

• Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.<br>
• How well those variables describe the bike demands<br>
• Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large
dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.<br>

## General Information
- Reading the data and understanding it.
- visualising the data and data preparation 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- What is the dataset that is being used?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 Company should focus on expanding business during Spring
- Conclusion 2 Company should focus on expanding business during may to oct 
- Conclusion 3 There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain & Holidays, they could probably use this time to
service the bikes without having business impact.
